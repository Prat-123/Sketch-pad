# Sketch-pad
Just a sketchpad made using basic HTML, CSS and jquery. Hovering over the grid will color it and hence allow you to sketch your image!

There are 4 buttons avaiable.

Each of them when pressed, prompt the user for a grid size and creates a grid of the corresponding size.

The "normal grid" button changes the color of the grid cells to a dark grey by hovering over them.

The "color grid" button changes the background color of the cells randomly whenever hovered over.

The "reset" button simply refreshes the grid with the previous input size so the user can start over.

The "gradient grid" button gradually changes the color of the cells ( by about 10% ) when hovered over.
